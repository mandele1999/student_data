# üè´ Student Performance Prediction

## Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to leverage data science techniques to `analyze` and `predict` student performance in secondary school. The project aims to assist educators and administrators in identifying at-risk students and understanding key factors influencing academic success. Below are the specific goals of the project:

- **Predict Student Grades**: Develop a predictive model to estimate student grades based on various demographic, academic, and personal features.

- **Identify At-Risk Students**: Classify students who may be at risk of underperforming, enabling targeted interventions to support them.

- **Feature Analysis**: Analyze and identify the most influential factors contributing to student performance, such as parental education, family background, health, and study habits.

- **Provide Actionable Insights**: Offer insights and recommendations to educators for improving student outcomes, based on data-driven analysis.

- **Build a User-Friendly Tool (Optional)**: Create an interactive dashboard or application to allow users to input data and receive predictions or insights in real-time.
