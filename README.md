## 📘 Overview

This project focuses on predicting academic performance among secondary school students using machine learning. The goal is to:

- Predict students' **Grade Point Average (GPA)**
- Classify students as **at-risk** based on predicted GPA (below a threshold)
- Compare classification model performance
- Uncover key factors that influence student success

This project empowers educators with early warnings and data-driven insights by combining academic, behavioral, and demographic features.

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains a range of features such as:

- Demographics (e.g., gender, ethnicity, age)
- Academic indicators (e.g., study time, absences, parental education)
- Behavioral traits (e.g., extracurriculars, volunteering, tutoring)

📄 A full breakdown of features, data types, and example values can be found in the [Data Catalog](docs/data_catalog.md) under the `docs/` folder.

## 🎯 Features / Objectives

- **GPA Prediction**: Estimate students' GPA using regression techniques
- **At-Risk Classification**:  
  - GPA-based risk flagging (Flag students as "At Risk" when the predicted GPA is below 2.0)
  - Direct classification using trained classifiers
  - **Model comparison view included in the Streamlit app**
- **Feature Importance**: Analyze key factors driving academic performance
- **Streamlit App**: Provide a simple user interface for live predictions
- **Insights for Educators**: Offer actionable data to improve student outcomes

## Usage (Streamlit App)

Once the app is running:

- Enter student details (age, study time, absences, etc.)
- Predict GPA using a trained Linear Regression model
- See two risk classification results:
  - Based on predicted GPA threshold
  - From a trained classifier model
- Compare model outputs in a single view
- Get instant feedback on potential student performance

## Results/Insights

- **Best Model**: Linear Regression for GPA prediction
- **Risk Classification**: Compare both GPA-threshold-based and trained classifier models
- **Top Influencers**: Parental education, study time, absences, and support systems emerged as significant predictors
- **App Feedback**: Real-time, easy-to-understand results to assist decision-makers in schools
